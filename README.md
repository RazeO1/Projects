Plant Disease Detection using ML:
This project is an approach to the development of plant disease recognition model, based on leaf image classification, by the use of deep convolutional networks. The developed model is able to recognize 38 different types of plant diseases out of of 14 different plants.Â¶
Plants: 'Tomato', 'Apple', 'Blueberry', 'Grape', 'Peach', 'Corn', 'Cherry', 'Squash', 'Strawberry', 'Pepper', 'Orange', 'Potato', 'Raspberry', 'Soybean'
